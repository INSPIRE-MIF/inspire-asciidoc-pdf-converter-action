= How the action works

The action is very simple. It's fired everytime commits are pushed to a branch or pull request (PR).
Everything happens inside a container created on GitHub servers to execute the action.
Then, the following steps are performed inside the container:

1. The pushed branch or PR is fetched in order to get the updated files in your repository. 
1. Those files are copied to the gh-pages branch. The branch is created if it doesn't exist, or overriden otherwise.
1. Pre-build command (optionally provided in the `pre_build` parameter of your workflow) is executed,
   to perform any task you want before the AsciiDoc files are built.
1. Then, every AsciiDoc file is built to html and added to the gh-pages branch.
1. AsciiDoc files are removed from the gh-pages branch. 
   All other files are kept, except yml configuration and .github/ directory.
1. Post-build command (optionally provided in the `post_build` parameter of your workflow) is executed,
   to perform any task you want after the AsciiDoc files are built.
1. Changes in the gh-pages are commited and pushed to you repository, publishing your updated website.
